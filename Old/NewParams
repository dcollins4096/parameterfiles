# New parameters, added Feb 3, 2006
# Improved all of those, added new: Aug 9 2006

#More detailed MHD solver parameters:
#MHD_Recon:  Reconstruction method. Options:
#           -1: if -1 in second spot, only one step is done.
#            0: Piecewise Constant
#            1: Picewise linear.
#MHD_Riemann: Riemann solver of choice.  Options:
#             0: Roe style (Harten), simple average for interface. (faster)
#             1: Roe style (Harten), roe average
#             2: nothing else right now
#MHD_Eps[4]: Epsilons for Haren method.  Softening parameter for small wave speed.  
#            For fast, alfven, slow, and contact waves (in that order)
MHD_Recon              = 0 1
MHD_Riemann            = 2 2
MHD_Eps                = 0.2 0.1 0.05 0.05

#  MHD_PLM_Slope[d, v, b, e]
#        1: Constant  (default)
#        2: Linear, Min Mod
#        3: Linear, Van Leer
#           note that the v's should all be the same, the b's should be the same.
MHD_PLM_Slope = 3 2 3 2

#  Which field to reconstruct: 
#  MHD_ReconFiled = A B
#  A is the 'kinetic' variable: 0 = velocity, 1 = momentum
#  B is the 'internal energy' variable: 0=Total Internal, 1=Gas Pressure, 2=TotalPressure, 3=Enthalpy.
MHD_ReconField = 0 2

#
# New electric field reconstruction parameters
# MHD_ElectricRecon is the reconstruction method.
# MHD_AthParam is the parameter for the relevant reconstruction method.  
#

MHD_ElectricRecon   = 1
MHD_AthParam   = 0.5

MHD_Flattening = 0
MHD_DiffusionMethod = 0 1
MHD_DiffusionParameter = 0.2
