# PROBLEM DEFINITION FILE: MHD/HD turbulence problem with stochastic forcing 
# Philipp Grete 2014
#
# Typical "turbulence-in-a-box" problem with non-static driving field.
# For details on stochastic forcing, see Schmidt et al. 2009 A&A 494, 127-145 
# http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:200809967
#
# Works/properly tested only on 3D uniform grids with MUSCL type solvers and MHDCT at this point.
# For hydro use HydroMethod 3
# For MHD use HydroMethod 4
# For MHDCT use HydroMethod 6
